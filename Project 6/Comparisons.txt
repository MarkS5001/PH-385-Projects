Project 6 Comparisons of rstep Values

I used rstep values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03, and 0.04.

From the graphs I can determine that smaller rsteps need more 
iterations to reach total diffusion, while bigger rsteps need
less time to reach total diffusion. Smaller rsteps never
leave the linear region for the 1000 durations.
