PH 385 Project 1 Main File

Models the projectile motion of a ball in three dimensions, including
quadratic air resistance and the Magnus force.

The user inputs the mass of the ball, diameter of the ball, air density, drag
coefficient, initial position, initial velocity, spin angular velocity,
and time step, all in SI units. This is followed by an output file name.
